# Project_2
Political Polarization

To execute this and visualize the graphics
1. run the ETL_election_data.ipynb (this will take a few minutes)
2. start python -m http.server in gitbash
3. run app.py

you can view all raw data on the flask pages localhost:5000/2008 or 2012 or 2016
you can view final page at localhost:8000

If the program wont run on your computer and because you get a CORS error you need to download this extension
