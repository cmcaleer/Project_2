Political Polarization

To execute this and visualize the graphics
1. Data will be exported to mongo database so start with mongod
2. run the ETL_election_data.ipynb (this will take a few minutes) 
3. start python -m http.server in gitbash
4. run app.py

you can view all raw data on the flask pages localhost:5000/2008 or 2012 or 2016
you can view final page at localhost:8000

If the program wont run on your computer because you get a CORS error you need to download this extension
